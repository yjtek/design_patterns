    "    - You have an algorithm (method) that you want to replace with a new one\n",
    "\n",
    "- Solution\n",
    "    - Replace the body of the method you want to change with the new algorithm, while keeping everything else the same (i.e. same method name/signature)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Motivation\n",
    "    - Sometimes, it is easier to start from scratch when things grow too complicated. This is basically saying, I tear down everything and re-implement\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to refactor\n",
    "    - Simplify the existing algorithm as much as possible\n",
    "    - Create new algorithm in a new method\n",
    "    - Replace old with new method and test\n",
