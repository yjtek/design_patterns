    "- Problem\n",
    "    - You are using some 3rd party code and you find that there is a functionality you'd like to introduce. However, for whatever reason, you are unable to modify the code, and the owners don't want to implement the feature.\n",
    "    - In addition, this happens often, so you don't want to haphazardly just add methods that extend class operations like in `7. Introduce Foreign Method`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Solution\n",
    "    - Create a new class with the method extension that either inherits from or wraps around the 3rd party class\n",
    "\n",
    "- Motivation\n",
    "    - If the logic is used multiple times in your code, you will avoid repetitive code chunks\n",
    "    - Grouping it in a class makes it clearer for maintainers why it was done\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to refactor\n",
    "    - Create a new class as a child or a wrapper of the utility class\n",
    "    - Constructor should make use of the utility class \n",
    "\n",
    "- Relationships with other refactoring methods\n",
    "    - Similar \n",
    "        - Introduce foreign method\n",

    "- Related code smells\n",
    "    - Incomplete Library Class\n",
