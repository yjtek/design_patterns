    "\n",
    "- Treatment\n",
    "    - You can try to single out the switch statement and put it in to the right class or method. `Extract Method` and `Move Method`\n",
    "    - If `switch` is based on type, then replace functionality with subclasses `Replace Type Code with Subclass`, or allow it to accept a state if subclassees cannot be created `Replace Type Code with State`\n",
    "    - Use polymorphism (same idea as subclassing)\n",
    "    - If there aren't too many conditions, and they are calling the same method with different parameters, you may not even need polymorphism. Just write different methods and call them accordingly\n",
    "    - If one of the conditions is `if X is None:`, you can consider creating a Null object specifically, so you can remove the `if` statement "
