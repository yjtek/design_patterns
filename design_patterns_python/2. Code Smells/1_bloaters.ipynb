    "    - If you have a lot of boilerplate defining things that must be implemented/present, `Extract interface`\n",
    "    - If the class is large because it handles multiple purposes (i.e. it spans multiple domains), you should try to separate the class into 2 domains and `Duplicate Observed Data` to ensure the behaviour is consistent\n",
    "        - For example, suppose we have a class that handles the processing of some data and presenting it in some UI\n",
