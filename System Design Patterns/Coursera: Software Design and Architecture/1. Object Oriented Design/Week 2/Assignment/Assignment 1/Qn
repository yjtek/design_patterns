Assignment Topic:

“Draw a UML class diagram of an Object-Oriented model for a car rental company that keeps track of cars, renters and renters renting cars ”

Create a UML class diagram to represent this information. Showing the correct classes and relationships is enough. Do not add attributes or methods to the classes.

Hint: You may want to make a class for "renters renting cars".

Note: This is an ungraded assignment for practice. The goal is to help you get familiar with our assessments (Peer Review) in our system.

You will be expected to upload a PDF of your UML class diagram. A free online tool you may use to make your diagram is Lucidchart. Note that you will have to make an account for this tool.
