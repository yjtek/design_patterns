RUBRIC

1. Are all classes used in the scenario included in the Sequence Diagram and have names to match the classes in the code? Must include classes: 
    - AddItemActivity
    - ItemList
    - Dimensions
    - Item

2. Are all method calls used in the scenario included in the Sequence Diagram and have names and parameters to match the classes that use them in the code? Must include methods: 
    - onCreate()
    - loadItems()
    - saveItem()
    - Dimensions constructor
    - Item constructor
    - addItem()
    - saveItems() 

3. Do all method call arrows lead to/from the correct classes? (i.e., are there classes calling the wrong methods or methods returning to the wrong classes?)

4. Does the diagram correctly complete the scenario?

5. Are all objects drawn in boxes with their own lifelines? Are activation boxes shown?

6. Does the Sequence Diagram use arrows to show messages being sent and dotted arrows to show data/control being returned?

7. Is it clear what the scenario is trying to achieve?

8. Does the UML sequence diagram read from left to right? (i.e., method calls have arrows going right and method returns have arrows going left)
