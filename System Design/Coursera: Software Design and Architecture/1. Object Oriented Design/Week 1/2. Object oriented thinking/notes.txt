- Think in terms of objects when coding
    - For example, look around you. What is a logical way to hierachically create objects around you?
        - Room object --> Contains everything
        - Desk object
        - Chair object
        - Laptop object
    - Different objects have different responsibilities, and responsibilities do not overlap
        - Chair is for sitting
        - Desk is for placing stuff
    - Different objects know different things
        - A chair knows it's max and min adjustable height
        - A door knows it's angle of opening and closing
