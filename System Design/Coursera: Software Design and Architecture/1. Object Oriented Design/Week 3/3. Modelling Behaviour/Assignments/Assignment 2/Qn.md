How to create your assignment

Review the code responsible for adding a new item.

Make a sequence diagram that captures the interactions of objects in the app when a new item is added.

Your sequence diagram should contain the following classes:

- AddItemActivity
- ItemList
- Dimensions
- Item

And contain calls of the following methods:

- onCreate()  (provided for you, see Template)
- loadItems()
- saveItem()  (provided for you, see Template)
- Dimensions constructor
- Item constructor
- addItem()
- saveItems()

Lastly, the activation of AddItemActivity should start with the call to “onCreate()”
