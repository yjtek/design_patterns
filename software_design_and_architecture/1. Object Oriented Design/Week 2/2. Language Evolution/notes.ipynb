    "- Programming Paradigms\n",
    "    - 60s: Imperative paradigm (COBOL, Fortran)\n",
    "        - Break up big programmes into smaller ones called subroutines (like methods in Java)\n",
    "        - The bottleneck was processing (because processing was costly), so all data was located in 1 place (global data) to allow all subroutines to access them\n",
    "        - There are problems here\n",
    "            - With global data, changes in data can lead to weird outcomes in the programmes\n",
    "    - Early 70s: Algol68, Pascal\n",
    "        - Introduction of local variables\n",
    "        - Subroutines were called procedures, and each could have nested procedures with their own variables\n",
    "        - Supports an \"abstract data type\", which is a type of data defined by the programmer and not built into the language. Lets you organise data in a meaningful way\n",
    "    - Mid 70s: C, modula2\n",
    "        - Programmes can now be organised into separate files\n",
    "        - What can/cannot be accessed is determined by a header file\n",
    "    - 80s: Object oriented design (Java, C++, C#)\n",
    "        - Make it easier to define abstract data types\n",
    "        - Structure a system around abstract data types called classes\n",
    "        - Let an abstract data type extend another\n",
    "        - `class` acts like a factory \n",
