    "- Inheritance is great, but can also lead to shitty code, creating more problems than they solve\n",

    "- Some guiding qns:\n",
    "    - Am I using inheritance to share attributes and behaviour without adding anything special to my subclasses? \n",
    "        - If yes, then you are misusing inheritance, because there is no reason for subclass to exist since the superclass is enough\n",
    "        - Let's suppose we want to make a pizza parlour object\n",
    "            - We make a `Pizza` class which lets you create many varieties of pizzas, and specific pizza types are  subclassing this \n",
    "            - BUT in this design, note that specific instances (e.g. `PepperoniPizza`) have all attributes and methods defined in the parent class.\n",
    "            - As a result, the subclass has no reason to exist. \n",
    "    - Are you breaking the Liskov substitution principle? (i.e. subclass can replace a superclass IFF subclass does not change functionality of superclass)\n",
    "        - Let's suppose we have an `Animal` class that can `eat` `walk` `run`\n",
    "        - But what if we create subclass `Whale`? Then `walk` and `run` methods in the superclass must be overwritten, because whales can do neither. \n",
    "    - Are you adding new, unrelated functionality in your subclass? If you are, you may need decomposition instead of inheritance!\n",
    "        - If inheritance doesn't suit your need, consider whether you can **decompose** the characteristics instead\n",
    "        - For example, you may be tempted to inherit `SmartPhone` from a superclass `Phone` and add camera methods\n"
