How to create your assignment

Review the code responsible for adding a new item and editing an existing item. 

Remember that an item can either be “Available” or “Borrowed” and can either have an image attached or not.

In this assignment you are to make a state diagram that captures the four possible states of an item.

- Available without photo
- Available with photo
- Borrowed without photo
- Borrowed with photo

Include arrows to indicate transitions between the states and label these transitions accordingly. And, remember to include the terminal state and to indicate the starting state.
