You have been asked by a local coffee shop to create a system that allows managers to see, edit and add employee information. You have decided to create them a web application. They have informed you that they may decide to grow and expand later on and would like the system to be flexible to expansion. In this case the MVC pattern should be used. 

Create a UML class diagram that displays the basic MVC pattern for this web application. The system should keep track of an employee’s name, ID number, job title and salary. The controller should be able to get the employee model’s properties (getter methods) and change the properties (setter methods). The view should only display employee info.
