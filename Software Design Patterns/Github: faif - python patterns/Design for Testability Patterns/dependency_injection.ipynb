    "        - For example, `B` may be super expensive, and you don't want to use `B` all the time\n",
    "        - Alternatively, `B` may be something you want to do in a few different ways\n",
    "    - To ensure that `B` is portable, you want to pass `B` into `A`\n",
    "    - This can be done in several ways:\n",
    "        - You can pass `B` into `A`'s constructor (i.e. __init__ method). This is known as constructor injection\n",
    "        - You can pass `B` into `A`'s method call that uses `B`. This is known as parameter injection\n",
    "        - You can write a method in `A` that sets the value of `B`. This is known as setter injection.\n",
