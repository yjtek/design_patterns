    "- Sometimes, you might want a way to check the initialisation for a specific object\n",

    "- What if I want to know how many objects of type `A` are floating around?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python lets you define this thing called a `metaclass`. Remember that in Python, all objects and instances of a class. In the same way, all classes are an instance of the `type` metaclass\n",
    "    - Think of metaclasses as something that lets you modify the default behaviour of a class\n",
    "    - Just as classes are object factories, a metaclass is a class factory\n",

    "- Note that calling the `type()` function with these 3 arguments `type(name: str, bases: tuple, dct: dict)` automatically creates a new class with the following characteristics\n",

    "    - `__bases__` is bases\n",
    "    - `__dict__` is dct\n",

    "- Once you understand what a metaclass is, the principle is the same as inheritance. \n",
    "- We define a new metaclass by subclassing it from `type`\n",
    "- Inside this metaclass, we instantiate a container array holding the names of all subclasses\n",
    "- Then, we write a custom `__new__` dunder for the metaclass\n",
    "    - This `__new__` will be called every time a new instance of a class or subclass from the metaclass is created\n",
    "    - So each time a new instance is created, register it to the container\n",
    "\n",
    "- At any point, you can simply call the container of the metaclass to see the number of objects of the metaclass type that have been instantiated"
